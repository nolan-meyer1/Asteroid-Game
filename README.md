# Asteroid-Game

This game was presented by my Proffessor Andy Harris at Ball State University's biennial Symposium on Games where over
100 participants talked about games. There were 8 presentations, 6 game demos, and keynote adress by Tyler Thompson the
creator of Cattalis series of video games.

This is a very fun asteriod game that I created. In this game you are the spaceship. The spaceship has some 
very interesting mechanics. It will move just like it would in the vaccum of space! You can only shoot one bullet at a time.
Your goal is to destroy asteriods and not let them hit the earth. If they hit the earth three times you lose. If your spaceship
gets hit three times you lose. In order to win you have to get a score of 50. You get points by destroying the asteriods. Each
asteriod is 10 points.
